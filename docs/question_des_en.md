## Background State Requirements

Questions that particularly require the inclusion of background state:

1. **How to adjust the pH value in a hydroponic system?**
   - Background requirements: Current pH value, crop type, water quality conditions, etc.

2. **Dealing with nutrient deficiencies or excesses in a hydroponic system?**
   - Background requirements: Specific nutrients that are in excess or deficient, current nutrient levels, crop requirements, etc.

3. **Setting light duration and intensity to promote crop growth?**
   - Background requirements: Current season, geographic location, crop type, existing light conditions, etc.

4. **Developing an irrigation plan to maximize water conservation.**
   - Background requirements: Current water resource status, climate conditions, crop water requirements, etc.

5. **How to check the current environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and light intensity?**
   - Background requirements: Although these are query-type questions, answering them requires linking to real-time environmental monitoring data.

6. **Checking for faults in the hydroponic system and identifying possible causes?**
   - Background requirements: System operation history, recent changes, time when problems occurred, etc.

The answers to these questions depend on specific background states and require real-time data or detailed system information to ensure that the provided solutions are both feasible and applicable to the current context. This design makes the language model more intelligent and personalized when applied.

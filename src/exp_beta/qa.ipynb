       " Document(page_content='(Gruda et al., 2019). In this study, we focused on determining the N2O emissions from hydroponic tomato and cucumber cultivation under real production conditions. Although the CO2 emissions from the root zone were about 10 times higher than the N2O emissions converted to CO2 equivalents (Table 3), the measured CO2 emissions do not affect the greenhouse gas budget of plant cultivation because of the preceding photosynthetic CO2 fixation (Smith et al., 2014). In contrast, CH4 emissions would also affect the GHG budget of plant cultivation but were not traceable in this study. Possibly, CH4 production was suppressed by rather aerobic conditions in the growing bags and by the high abundance of nitrate fertilizer (Le Mer and Roger, 2001). Despite a few gaps, the data collected during 2019 and 2020 was sufficient for estimating seasonal N2O emissions from rock wool substrates, since the combined dataset from both years covers all different growth stages of the two vegetable plants.'),\n",

The existing data from new rock wool growing bags showed very low N2O emission rates (on average 0.5 g N2O–N ha−1 d−1) at the beginning of the cultivation period on 4 March, and low emission rates (on average 1.6 g N2O–N ha−1 d−1) at the end of the cultivation period in May (still with fertigation). Cumulative N2O emissions from the late season cultivation in 2019 were on average 0.74 kg N2O–N ha−1 (Table 3). Despite the shorter cultivation period, the N2O emissions were about 50% higher in the north block (on average 0.89 kg N2O–N ha−1) compared to the south block (on average 0.60 kg N2O–N ha−1). Compared to the new rock wool growing bags, the re-used rock wool growing bags had on average 9 and 25% higher N2O emissions in the north and south block, respectively.

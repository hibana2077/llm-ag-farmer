Firstly, while some Pseudomonas species are known for promoting plant growth, others can be pathogens to plants, and some can spoil food. This could potentially lead to issues with plant health and food safety if pathogenic or spoilage species are prevalent. Additionally, the dominance of Pseudomonas could indicate specific environmental conditions or nutrient profiles that favor this genus, which might need to be adjusted to promote a more balanced microbial ecosystem. Lastly, the presence of Pseudomonas highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and possibly implementing control measures to manage the microbial population in hydroponic systems to ensure both plant health and food safety.'}]\n",

ERF and MYC transcription factors are involved in stress responses, and their modulation can impact JA signaling and plant growth under stress. ARF transcription factors are crucial in auxin signaling, helping to regulate the expression of downstream genes required for cell proliferation and callus development.
